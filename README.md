### This application is designed to interact with various devices and sensorsat home. To do this, it uses the modbus over tcp / ip protocol. I conceived it as a housekeeper where a device will be installed that will allow you to control various electrical loads (lighting, air conditioners, heaters, relays, etc.) and receive data for further processing and display. Personally, I use ESP8266 with Atmega328 (Arduino uno) bundles. If you are interested in this topic, you have your own vision. Feel free to improve and modify the project, because it was originally conceived as an open source.Email address for feedback: daineko.a32@mail.ru
